    Parameters
    ----------
    inner_qs: SingleAnnotPoolBasedQueryStrategy
        Query strategy used for further selection of the samples.
    missing_label : scalar or string or np.nan or None, default=np.nan
        Value to represent a missing label.
    random_state: numeric | np.random.RandomState, optional
        Random state for candidate selection.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data set. This data set is used for the partitioning of
            the space into clusters, by the query strategy.
        y : array-like of shape (n_samples)
            Labels of the training data set (possibly including unlabeled ones
            indicated by self.MISSING_LABEL.
        inner_qs_dict : dict
            Dictionary for the further arguments of the query strategy besides
            `X`, `y` and `candidates`.
        sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples), optional (default=None)
            Weights of training samples in `X`.
        candidates : None or array-like of shape (n_candidates), dtype=int or
            array-like of shape (n_candidates, n_features),
            optional (default=None)
            If candidates is None, the unlabeled samples from (X,y) are
            considered as candidates.
            If candidates is of shape (n_candidates) and of type int,
            candidates is considered as the indices of the samples in (X,y).
            If candidates is of shape (n_candidates, n_features), the
            candidates are directly given in candidates (not necessarily
            contained in X). This is not supported by all query strategies.
        batch_size : int, optional (default=1)
            The number of samples to be selected in one AL cycle.
        return_utilities : bool, optional (default=False)
            If true, also return the utilities based on the query strategy.

        Returns
        -------
        query_indices : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size)
            The query_indices indicate for which candidate sample a label is
            to queried, e.g., `query_indices[0]` indicates the first selected
            sample.
            If candidates is None or of shape (n_candidates), the indexing
            refers to samples in X.
            If candidates is of shape (n_candidates, n_features), the indexing
            refers to samples in candidates.
        utilities : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, n_samples) or
            numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, n_candidates)
            The utilities of samples after each selected sample of the batch,
            e.g., `utilities[0]` indicates the utilities used for selecting
            the first sample (with index `query_indices[0]`) of the batch.
            Utilities for labeled samples will be set to np.nan.
            If candidates is None or of shape (n_candidates), the indexing
            refers to samples in X.
            If candidates is of shape (n_candidates, n_features), the indexing
            refers to samples in candidates.
